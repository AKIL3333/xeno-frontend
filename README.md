# Data Ingestion & Insights Applications
Welcome to the frontend of Data Ingestion & Insights Applications website!!!
This application allows users to sign up,login and view analytical insights of their shopify stores connected with my app.
Note:You cannot connect with this app unless you have your store tested with this app.For testing purposes,use email:aki@gmail.com and password:aki.
## Tech Stack
React.js  – UI library
Axios – API requests
React Router DOM – Routing
Recharts – Data visualization
CSS – Styling

### How to get Started:
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:
### 1.Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
### 2. Installing the dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js (>= 16) and npm installed. Then run:npm install
### 3.Configure API endpoint
Inside src/api/axiosClient.js, make sure the base URL points to your backend:


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
